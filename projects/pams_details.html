            <h2>PAMS - Project Allocation and Management System</h2>
            <p>
                This is my comprehensive project management system designed to
                manage final year projects for university students. The system
                includes features such as group formation, project proposal,
                report submission, project allocation, and a marking system. It
                provides students, supervisors, and coordinators with tools to
                streamline the project management process. Students can create
                groups, propose projects, and submit reports through the system.
                Supervisors have the authority to accept projects, provide
                instructions, and allocate teams. Coordinators can assign
                submission dates and manage project allocations. Additionally,
                there's a built-in marking system to evaluate project progress.
                The system also offers messaging and notification features to
                facilitate communication among users.
